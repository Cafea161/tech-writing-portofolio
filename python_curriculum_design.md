# Technical Curriculum Architecture (Python & SQL)
_Please note that some of my past documentation and curriculum work at Skillab is 
proprietary or part of internal systems that cannot be shared publicly. The provided GitHub 
repository contains reconstructed public versions and representative samples of my structural 
work._

This document showcases my work in **organizing and structuring technical knowledge** for professional education. In my role as a Curriculum Producer, I collaborated with Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) to transform their expertise into logical, user-friendly learning paths.

## My Strategic Contribution

While lead instructors provided the technical troubleshooting, my responsibility was the **Information Architecture** and **Narrative Flow**:

1. **Pedagogical Structuring:** I determined the "Learning Path," ensuring that students weren't overwhelmed by complexity too early.
2. **Resource Auditing:** I reviewed all technical assets (scripts, slides, tutorials) to ensure clarity, consistency, and accessibility for non-expert learners.
3. **Bridge to the User:** I translated the expert's "raw code" perspective into a structured educational experience - building an online shop.
