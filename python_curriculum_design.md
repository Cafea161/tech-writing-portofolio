# Python Professional Curriculum Design

This document outlines the structure of the Python Professional course I developed at Skillab. It demonstrates my ability to organize complex technical topics into a progressive learning path.

## Module 1: Python Fundamentals
* **Lesson 1:** Introduction to Python (Environment setup, syntax basics)
* **Lesson 2:** Data Types and Operations I
* **Lesson 3:** Data Types and Operations II
* **Lesson 4:** Control Flow (Conditionals and Loops)
* **Lesson 5:** Functions (Definitions, arguments, and return values)

## Module 2: Intermediate Concepts & Architecture
* **Lesson 6:** Modules & Packages
* **Lesson 7:** Object-Oriented Programming (Part 1)
* **Lesson 8:** Object-Oriented Programming (Part 2)
* **Lesson 9:** Python Standard Library
* **Lesson 10:** Python Collections (Advanced data structures)

## Module 3: Advanced Technical Implementation
* **Lesson 11:** File Handling & I/O Operations
* **Lesson 12:** Working with External Libraries
* **Lesson 13:** Database Integration (SQL & Python connectivity)
* **Lesson 14:** Network Programming basics
* **Lesson 15:** Debugging and Error Handling strategies

## Module 4: High-Level Topics
* **Lesson 16:** Asynchronous Programming
* **Lessons 17 - 20:** Advanced Topics (Deep dives into specialized Python implementations)

### Practical Assessment Design
Each module included a hands-on project (Homework/Tema) designed to validate technical competency in areas such as:
- Standard Library implementation
- File system manipulation
- Network communication
- Database management
