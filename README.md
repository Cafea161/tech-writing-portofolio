# Portfolio: Technical Communication & Information Architecture

Welcome to my repository! Here are samples of my work that connect technical logic and user-centric documentation.

## 1. Technical Curriculum Architecture
**Project:** Python & SQL Professional Courses (Skillab, robot_dreams)
- **Role:** Curriculum Producer / Information Architect
- **Description:** I collaborated with Subject Matter Experts to transform raw technical knowledge into logical learning paths. I focused on pedagogical flow, ensuring that complex concepts (like SQL Normalization or Python OOP) were accessible to professional learners.
- **File:** [View Curriculum Structure](./curriculum_design.md)

## 2. Research Automation Tools
**Project:** Python-based Ethics NewsAPI Content Scraper
- **Description:** A practical script developed to automate the retrieval of titles for Applied Ethics research.
- **File:** [View Script](./ethics_scraper.py)
